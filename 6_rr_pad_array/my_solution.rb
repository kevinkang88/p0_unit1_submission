# U1.W3: Review and Refactor: Pad an Array

# I worked on this challenge [by myself]



# 1. First Person's solution I liked
# catherinev took different path compared to my solution in solving this
# problem. They started writing code for Array#pad! since, it was faster 
# to write destructive self than the opposite. I also thought Array#map 
# was a clever way to assign self a new object id without altering its 
# contents. Also learned how for..in iteration method can be useful to
# adding paddings as well. To improve this code, they could eliminate 
# explicit return keywords.    
# Copy solution here:
class Array 
    def pad (number, object = nil)
		new_array = self.map{|a| a}
		if new_array.length >= number
			return new_array
		else
			for i in new_array.length...number
				new_array [i] = object
			end
			return new_array
		end
	end

	def pad! (number, object = nil)
		if self.length >= number
			return self
		else
			for i in self.length...number
				self [i] = object
			end
			return self
		end
	end
end



# 2. Second Person's solution I liked
#    What I learned from this solution

# zmitton's solution caught my eye because of how he solved the problem 
# within ten lines. He defined Array#pad! first then implemented it 
# inside Array#pad. I learned clone method which duplicates an object 
# with different id which is perfect for non destructible method such as 
# pad. Also the use of until method made the code very readable. I cannot 
# find any way to refactor this code any further.

# Copy solution here:

class Array
    def pad!(minlength, fillValue = nil)
        self << fillValue until self.length >= minlength
        return self
    end
    
    def pad(minlength, fillValue = nil)
        self.clone.pad!(minlength, fillValue)
    end
end



# 3. My original solution:

class Array
  def pad(min_size,opt_pad=nil)
    new_array = [] + self
    array_length = self.length
    pad_size = min_size - array_length
    if min_size <= array_length
      new_array
    else
      pad_size.times { new_array.push(opt_pad) }
    end
    new_array
  end

  def pad!(min_size,opt_pad=nil)
    pad_size = min_size - self.length
    if min_size <= self.length
      self 
    else
      pad_size.times { self.push(opt_pad) }
    end
    self
  end
end

# 4. My refactored solution:

class Array
  def pad(min_size,opt_pad=nil)
    self.clone.pad!(min_size,opt_pad)
  end

  def pad!(min_size,opt_pad=nil)
    pad_size = min_size - self.length
    if min_size <= self.length
      self 
    else
      pad_size.times { self.push(opt_pad) }
    end
    self
  end
end


# 5. Reflection

# When I first saw that this exercise is on refactoring our 
# previous solution, I didnâ€™t know if I could find a better way 
# to improve the code. However, refactoring after reviewing others 
# solution gave me a different perspective and ways to solve the 
# problem. This time when I refactored I set up my Array#pad! then 
# included it in Array#pad. I also implemented clone method to 
# duplicate and not alter the original code instead of using the 
# long way of constructing new blank array and concatenating elements
# into it.
